# MADA-PL

This repository implements in Pytorch-Lightning:
  * (MADA) Multi-Adversarial Domain Adaptation (https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02176) 
  * (DANN) Domain Adversarial Training (https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07818) 

We also used the Weight and Biases (https://wandb.ai/home) logger to track our experiments.
